# Deloitte Data Analytics Job Simulation (Forage)

This repository contains my completed work for the Deloitte Data Analytics Virtual Job Simulation, offered via Forage.

## Overview

As part of this simulation, I stepped into the role of a Data Analyst at Deloitte to solve real-world data challenges involving machine telemetry and pay equity.

I completed the following two tasks:

## Tasks Completed

### Task 1: Telemetry Data Analysis using Tableau

- Analyzed telemetry data collected from four global factories (Tokyo, Osaka, Berlin, Shenzhen).
- Identified which factory had the most machine downtime and which device types broke most frequently.
- Used Tableau to build two bar charts:
  - Downtime per Factory
  - Downtime per Device Type
- Created an interactive dashboard allowing filtering by factory.

- `/task1/task1_tableau_summary.md`

### Task 2: Gender Pay Equality Classification using Excel

- Worked with an Excel dataset containing equality scores by factory and job role.
- Added a new column to classify fairness into:
  - Fair (Â±10)
  - Unfair (>10 or <-10)
  - Highly Discriminative (>20 or <-20)
- Used Excel formulas to apply this logic and optionally visualized the classifications.

- `/task2/task2_pay_equality_summary.md`

## Tools Used

- Tableau Public (for dashboard creation)
- Microsoft Excel (for data classification)
- Analytical thinking, data visualization, and communication skills

## Notes

This simulation helped me apply real-world data analytics concepts including:
- Interactive visual analysis using dashboards
- Classification and interpretation of quantitative indicators
- Attention to business context and client-driven goals
